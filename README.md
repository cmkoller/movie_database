This is a Sinatra project for displaying movie information as read from a CVS file.

The home page displays a list of movies in alphabetical order, broken into pages.

The user can use the home page search box to search for a particular phrase, and movies containing that phrase in the title or description will be returned.

Clicking a movie title will bring you to a page with more details on that movie.
